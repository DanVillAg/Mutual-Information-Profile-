We test this hypothesis by computing the correlation coef-
ficient of the AMI profile of 100,000 5 kb long fragments
of the E. coli genome with the AMI profile of the entire
sequence. We also compute the correlation coefficient of
100,000 random fragments from the S. aureus genome
(accession number NC_002758) with the AMI profile of
the E. coli genome. The histograms of the correlation coef-
ficient are shown in Figure 5. The results clearly demon-
strate both the pervasiveness of the AMI signature as well
as its specificity

The program provides a means of
visualizing the distances between AMI profiles and quali-
tative evidence for clustering. We can also show visual evi-
dence of clustering using a singular value decomposition.
